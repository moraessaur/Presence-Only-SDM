# Introduction

In this document, we show how different **species distribution models (SDMs)** can be fitted to **presence-background** data in the R programming language. Several statistical and machine learning algorithms are presented here, covering all methods presented in the main text. Each model is fitted using the same code we used for producing the results in our paper. Some additional suggestions are also provided that could be useful for smaller modeling exercises, but that we could not apply due to the large number of species and computation limits. The code provided here can be used for modeling any binary response.
